***1. What is React Native?***<br><br>
React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android.
 It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, 
 it targets mobile platforms. 
 In other words: web developers can now write mobile applications that look and feel truly “native,” all from the comfort of a JavaScript library that we already know and love.
  Plus, because most of the code you write can be shared between platforms, React Native makes it easy to simultaneously develop for both Android and iOS.

***2.what is the difference between React and React Native ?***<br>
ReactJS<br>
* JavaScriptReact has as its main focus Web Development.
* It is used for developing web applications.
* It can be executed on all platforms.
* It uses a JavaScript library and CSS for animations.
* It uses React-router for navigating web pages.
* It can use code components, which saves a lot of valuable time.<br><br>
React Native<br><br>
An extension of React, niched on Mobile Development.
* It is used for developing mobile applications.
* It is not platform independent. It takes more effort to be executed on all platforms.
* It comes with built-in animation libraries.It comes with built-in animation libraries.
* It has built-in Navigator library for navigating mobile applications.
* It can reuse React Native UI components & modules which allow hybrid apps to render natively.
* In this, Native uses its API to render code for mobile applications.<br><br>

***3.Advantages of React Native***
There are several advantages of React Native for building mobile applications. Some of them are given below:

* (a)Cross-Platform Usage: It provides the facility of "Learn once write everywhere." It works for both platform Android as well as iOS devices.
* (b)Class Performance: The code written in React Native are compiled into native code, which enables it for both operating systems as well as it functions in the same way on both the platforms.
* (c)JavaScript: JavaScript knowledge is used to build native mobile apps.
* (d)Community: The large community of ReactJS and React Native helps us to find any answer we require.
* (e)Hot Reloading: Making a few changes in the code of your app will be immediately visible during development. If the business logic is changed, its reflection is live reloaded on screen.
* (f)Improving with Time: Some features of iOS and Android are still not supported, and the community is always inventing the best practices.
* (g)Native Components: We will need to write some platform specific code if we want to create native functionality, which is not designed yet.
* (h)Existence is Uncertain: As Facebook develop this framework, its presence is uncertain since it keeps all the rights to kill off the project anytime. As the popularity of React Native rises, it is unlikely to happen.<br><br>
***4.Disadvantage of React Native***<br><br>
* (a) React Native is Still New and Immature: React Native is a newbie in Android and iOS programming languages and is still in its improvement stage, which can have a negative impact on the apps.
* (b)Learning is Tough: React Native is not easy to learn, especially for a fresher in the app development field.
* (c)It Lacks the Security Robustness: React Native is a JavaScript library and open-source framework, which creates a gap in the security robustness. When you are creating banking and financial apps where data is highly confidential, experts advice not to choose React Native.
* (d) It Takes More Time to Initialize: React Native takes a lot of time for initializing the runtime even for the hi-tech gadgets and devices.<br><br>
